# THE RED TASK - 31/ATLAS Interception Mission

**THE RED TASK** is a futuristic space mission dashboard and visualization platform designed to track and simulate the interception of the **31/ATLAS** asteroid. It features a premium, immersive interface with real-time orbital mechanics simulations and mission control capabilities.

## Features

- **Immersive Hero Section**: A stunning landing page with 3D-style sphere animations, orbiting particles, and deep space aesthetics.
- **Orbital Visualization**: Real-time JavaScript simulation of solar system dynamics, tracking the Earth, asteroid 31/ATLAS, and other celestial bodies.
- **Mission Dashboard**: interactive control panel for:
  - Viewing live telemetry (Distance, Velocity, Orbital Period).
  - Calculating mission trajectories (Hohmann Transfers).
  - Adjusting simulation parameters (Orbit Eccentricity, Semi-Major Axis).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Glassmorphism UI, shooting stars, parallax backgrounds, and smooth CSS animations.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Advanced animations, gradients, flexbox/grid layouts, and glassmorphism effects.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: DOM manipulation, animation logic, and simulation calculations.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
